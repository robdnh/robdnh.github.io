*** I'm using markdown "reference style" links for readability.
*** Reference links are enclosed in brackets [ ] instead of parentheses ( ).
*** See the bottom of this document for the declaration of the reference variables
*** for contributors-url, forks-url, etc. This is an optional, concise syntax you may use.

This is really just a pared down version of a web application I built for the purposes of testing cloud services integrations in AWS. (See feature-rich example site in [serverless-rekog-widget](https://github.com/robdnh/serverless-rekog-widget))
